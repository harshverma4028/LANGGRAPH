       " 'explanation': 'This joke is a delightful play on words that uses the physical characteristics of a samosa to create a mental health metaphor!\\n\\n**The Setup:** The joke personifies a samosa (a popular triangular fried pastry from South Asian cuisine) as someone seeking psychological help.\\n\\n**The Punchline Works on Two Levels:**\\n\\n1. **\"Too many layers\"** - Samosas literally have multiple layers of thin, flaky pastry that are folded to create their distinctive triangular shape. But in therapy-speak, having \"layers\" refers to complex emotional issues, past traumas, or psychological defenses that need to be \"worked through\" or unpacked.\\n\\n2. **\"Feeling fried\"** - Samosas are deep-fried as part of their cooking process, making them crispy and golden. But \"feeling fried\" is also a common expression meaning feeling exhausted, burnt out, or overwhelmed by stress.\\n\\nThe humor comes from this clever double meaning - the samosa\\'s actual physical properties (layered and fried) perfectly match common psychological struggles that might lead someone to seek therapy. It\\'s a lighthearted way of normalizing therapy while also celebrating wordplay!\\n\\nThe emoji combination 🥟😄 adds to the playful tone, making it clear this is meant to be a fun, food-based pun rather than making light of actual mental health issues.'}"
